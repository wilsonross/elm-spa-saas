## About
<div>
  <br />
  <p>I initially started writing this project in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> using the <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> framework. A colleague recommended <a target="_blank" href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> to me last year, and I decided to try the functional paradigm. Everything in the project was rewritten. <a target="_blank" href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a> was initially chosen as a content management system to serve as an application back-end. During the change of languages, <a target="_blank" href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a> got dropped in favour of <a target="_blank" href="https://pocketbase.io/">PocketBase</a>.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The application is still under active development. Some features - account management, for example - are currently at a bare minimum. Furthermore, refactoring the app is a priority to improve code reusability and readability. I plan to add additional features to the back-end by modifying the <a target="_blank" href="https://pocketbase.io/">PocketBase</a> installation. These will include security improvements, such as adding CSRF token support and validation.</p>
